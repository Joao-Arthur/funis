# jsFns

A optionated type-safe library for the functions the standand js lacks.

## Justification

One day I realized I had written the `range` function in the third project that same year. Then I realized it was time to create a js library for the functions that should be in the standard js library.
The aim of this library is to be a helper for modern day js, instead of a `polyfill library`.
